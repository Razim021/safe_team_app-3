# SAFE Team Online Ride Request Application

A web-based ride request system for students at the University of South Florida (USF) to request nighttime safety rides around campus.

## Project Overview

The SAFE Team app replaces the traditional call-based method of requesting rides with a user-friendly online interface. Students can log in using their USF credentials, request a ride, view estimated wait times, track request status, and receive notificationsâ€”all through a secure, accessible web platform.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login with USF credentials
- **Ride Requests**: Simple interface for requesting rides around campus
- **Wait-Time Estimation**: Real-time updates on expected wait times
- **Request Tracking**: Follow the status of your ride in real-time
- **Notifications**: Receive updates when a driver accepts your ride or arrives
- **Driver Interface**: Drivers can view and manage ride requests
- **Admin Dashboard**: Administrators can manage users, rides, and locations

## Technologies Used

- Ruby 3.2.2
- Rails 7.0.7
- SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)
